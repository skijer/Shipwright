# SoH: Unbound — archive format specification

**Format version 2.** This document is the contract. It lists every way the contents of an
`.o2r` archive read by SoH: Unbound may differ from a vanilla Ship of Harkinian archive, as seen
from outside — by a tool that writes one (Prelude of Light), a tool that reads one, or a person
inspecting the zip. It says *what* is accepted and *what it means*; it does not say how SoH
implements it or why a decision was made. Those live in the other `unbound-docs/` files and may
change; this document changes only with the format version.

Reviews of SoH: Unbound code and of Prelude's Unbound export are held to this text. A fix that
would require changing this text is a format change, not a fix.

Normative words: **must**, **must not**, **accepted** (read without error), **rejected** (the
document or archive is not loaded and an error is logged), **ignored** (read without effect).

---

## 1. Container

1. An Unbound archive is a zip file with the `.o2r` extension, exactly as vanilla. Stored
   (uncompressed) and deflated entries are both accepted.
2. The vanilla `version` file at the archive root is unchanged: when present it **must** be a
   supported ROM hash, exactly as vanilla. The game still needs one mounted archive with a valid
   `version`.
3. A **base** archive (one that provides vanilla scenes in the §4 form) **must** contain
   `unbound.json` (§6) at its root with `"scenes"` in its `features`; that is how a reader
   detects the format and routes vanilla scenes to `scene.json`. A mod layer may omit
   `unbound.json` or carry one without `"scenes"`; its documents merge regardless.
4. Every path not listed in this specification is a vanilla resource and is read exactly as
   vanilla SoH reads it (last mounted archive wins, whole file).
5. Archives are mounted in layers, lowest first: SoH's own archive, the vanilla game archives,
   the Unbound base archive (`oot-unbound.o2r`), then mods in SoH's mod-load order. The
   *structured documents* of §4–§7 merge across layers (§3); everything else replaces whole.
6. Once a base is mounted, every vanilla scene is read from `scenes/<scene>/scene.json` (§4.1);
   vanilla-format scene resources in any layer are not read.

## 2. Value conventions

These apply to every JSON document in this specification.

| Kind | Written by the converter | Accepted on read |
|---|---|---|
| Integer | JSON number | JSON number (a fractional number is truncated toward zero); a string that is, in full and without whitespace, an optionally signed decimal or `0x` hex integer (`"0x0F12"`, `"3858"`, `"-5"`); a JSON boolean (`true` = 1) |
| Number (may be fractional) | JSON number | JSON number; a string that is, in full and without whitespace, a decimal number with optional fraction/exponent, or a `0x` hex integer. Booleans are not numbers. |
| Vector | `[x, y, z]` of numbers | 3-element array; extra elements ignored; fewer than 3 → the whole vector is `[0,0,0]` |
| Colour | `[r, g, b]` integers 0–255 | 3-element array |
| Path | string, forward slashes, archive-relative, no leading slash | string |
| Key of a **keyed list** | string | any unique string |
| Key of a **positional list** | decimal index string `"0"`, `"1"`, … | decimal index strings; the set **must** be contiguous from `"0"` after merging (§3.2) |

- Position vectors (`pos`, path points, point lights) are **numbers** and may be fractional.
  Collision data — vertices, bounds, water-box extents — is **integral** (§4.4): the reader
  rounds a fractional JSON value, and `collision.bin` holds integers. Rotation vectors (`rot`) are integers in the
  vanilla binary-angle unit (−32768…32767). Direction vectors (`dir`, `light1Dir`, `light2Dir`)
  are integers −128…127.
- A missing scalar key takes the zero/empty default of its type unless this document states
  another default (the non-zero defaults are: `time.hour/minute/increment` 255, `mesh.format` 1,
  `water box.room` −1, registry `endTransition`/`startTransition` 2). A key whose value has the
  wrong JSON type is treated as missing.
- Ranges stated in this document are requirements on the **writer**. Unless a rule says
  "rejected", the reader does not validate them: an out-of-range value is stored in the engine
  field's width and wraps.
- Unknown keys are ignored.
- Keys beginning with `$` are reserved (§3); an unknown `$` key is ignored.
- JSON comments (`//` and `/* */`) are accepted in every document. The first byte of a §4
  document **must** be `{` — no leading whitespace, comment, or byte-order mark.

## 3. Layering and merge rules

Applies to every path in §4–§7. For a given path, the documents from all mounted archives are
merged, lowest layer first:

1. **Objects** merge key-wise, recursively. A later layer's value for a key replaces the earlier
   value; an object value merges into an object value.
2. **`null`** deletes the key. In a positional list a deletion is legal only at the tail: if the
   merged result has a hole (`"0"`, `"1"`, `"3"`), the document is **rejected**.
   A layer that is not parsable JSON is skipped with an error; the remaining layers still merge.
3. **Arrays** replace whole (vectors, colours, `$order`, `paths`).
4. **`"$replace": true`** inside an object means "discard every lower layer's value of this
   object"; the key is removed from the merged result.
5. **`"$order": [keys…]`** on a keyed list gives the engine order of the listed keys. The
   highest layer that provides `$order` wins. A key listed more than once counts once; a listed
   key that does not exist is ignored. Keys not listed follow the listed ones in *key sort
   order*: keys that are optionally signed decimal integers first, ascending numerically, then
   the rest in byte order. A keyed list without `$order` is entirely in key sort order. `$order`
   is legal only on keyed lists (`actors`, the scene registry and its `entrances`; on `messages` it has
   no effect); on a positional list the document is **rejected**.
6. **`"$schema": "<type>/<version>"`** names the document type. A §4 document is **rejected**
   unless at least one layer provides it; the highest layer that provides it wins, and only a
   top-level `$schema` string counts. A version this document does not list as accepted is
   **rejected**. A §5 document carries `$schema` as self-description; the reader does not
   validate it. §6 and §7 documents carry none.
7. A layer may omit any key, including `$schema`; only the merged document has to be complete.
8. Bulk files (`collision.bin`, display lists, textures, cutscenes, audio, objects) do not merge:
   the highest layer wins.

## 4. Scenes

### 4.1 Paths

```
scenes/<scene>/scene.json           $schema unbound/scene/1
scenes/<scene>/rooms/<n>.json       $schema unbound/room/1      n = room number, decimal
scenes/<scene>/collision.json       $schema unbound/collision/3
scenes/<scene>/collision.bin        bulk, referenced from collision.json
scenes/<scene>/paths/<name>.json    $schema unbound/paths/1
```

`<scene>` for a vanilla scene is the vanilla scene file name without `_scene` (`spot00`, `ydan`);
Master Quest variants are `<scene>_mq`. A custom scene may use any directory name that does not
collide with a vanilla one; it is reached only through the registry (§7.1).

Bulk resources a scene document points at (display lists, textures, cutscenes) keep the paths
they had in the archive the scene was converted from; this specification does not rename them.

### 4.2 `scene.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "unbound/scene/1",
  "collision": "scenes/spot00/collision.json",
  "rooms": { "0": "scenes/spot00/rooms/0.json" },
  "setups": { "0": { … }, "1": { … } }
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `collision` | path | The scene's `collision.json`. A scene without one has no collision. |
| `rooms` | positional list of paths | Room documents in room-number order. A scene without rooms draws nothing. |
| `setups` | object keyed by setup index | Setup `"0"` is required; the document is **rejected** without it. `"0"`–`"3"` are child-day, child-night, adult-day, adult-night; `"4"` and up are cutscene setups. Every setup is **complete** — nothing is inherited from setup `"0"`. The setup with the highest index determines how many setups exist; a missing intermediate index, or an index beyond the highest, behaves as vanilla's empty alternate header: the engine falls back to setup `"0"` (setup `"3"` first tries `"2"`). Keys are decimal integers; other keys are ignored. |

Every key of a setup is optional. An absent key means the corresponding scene command is not
emitted and the engine keeps its default state, exactly as a vanilla scene that lacks the command.

A setup object holds:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `specialObjects` | `{ elfMessage: int, globalObject: int }` | Navi hint id, global object id |
| `skybox` | `{ id, weather, indoors, unk }` ints | vanilla skybox settings |
| `sound` | `{ seq, natureAmbience, reverb }` ints, optional `song`: path | vanilla sound settings. `song` names a custom sequence (`custom/music/<Name>`, a streamed or `.seq` sequence any mounted archive provides) that plays wherever the setup's theme would: `seq` **must stay a vanilla id** — a song is referred to only by path, custom sequences having no stable numeric id — and remains the theme heard when no mounted layer provides the song (the reader logs the miss). `null` unbinds. **Ranges:** `seq` is `0..109` or `127` (no music); `natureAmbience` is `0..19`, `19` meaning none. Unlike the §2 rule, an out-of-range value does not wrap: the reader stores the "none" value and logs it, because the engine indexes tables with these bytes and an out-of-range id crashes it. A `song` bound on a `seq` of `127` never plays (there is no theme for it to replace); the reader logs that too. |
| `cameraSettings` | `{ cameraMovement, worldMapArea }` ints | vanilla camera settings |
| `cutscene` | path | cutscene resource |
| `paths` | array of paths | pathway documents (§4.5); their `paths` lists are concatenated in array order, and a path index is a position in that concatenation |
| `lighting` | positional list of lighting entries (below) | ≤ 255 entries (§9); a `lightSetting` index at or beyond the count selects entry `"0"` |
| `entrances` | positional list of `{ spawn: int 0–255, room: int }` | `spawn` indexes `spawns`; `room` is a room number |
| `spawns` | positional list of `{ id: int, pos: vec, rot: vec, params: int }` | player spawn entries; `params` is the vanilla packed word |
| `exits` | positional list of exit values (below) | referenced 1-based by surface types (§4.4) |
| `transitionActors` | positional list of transition-actor entries (below) | |
| `materialAnims` | positional list of material-animation entries (below) | Per-frame recipes bound to runtime segments before the rooms draw (animated water, lava, colour cycles, flipbooks). Entries apply in list order: a later entry on the same segment and pass wins, and an entry wins over what the scene's draw config bound to that segment. A reader without this key (Unbound 0.5 and earlier) ignores it and the geometry draws unanimated. |

The vanilla `SetCsCamera` command (0x02) carries no data in SoH and has no JSON form.

**Lighting entry**

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ambient`, `light1Color`, `light2Color`, `fogColor` | colour | |
| `light1Dir`, `light2Dir` | direction vector | |
| `fogNear` | int 0–1000 | vanilla fog-near value, **without** the blend-rate bits (the reader keeps the low 10 bits) |
| `fogBlendRate` | int 0–63 | the vanilla high six bits of the packed fog-near word (the reader keeps the low 6 bits) |
| `fogFar` | int | vanilla fog-far / far-plane value |
| `fogStart`, `fogEnd`, `drawDistance`, `nearPlane` | number, optional | **World-unit fog.** If any of the first three is present the entry uses world-unit fog: fog is fully clear at `fogStart` and fully dense at `fogEnd`, geometry is drawn to `drawDistance`, and the near plane is `nearPlane` (0 = the vanilla 10). Defaults when only some are present: `drawDistance` ← `fogFar` (or 12 800 if `fogFar` is 0); `fogEnd` ← `drawDistance`; `fogStart` ← the distance the vanilla `fogNear` would have produced; `nearPlane` ← 0. Absent all three, the entry has vanilla fog and vanilla limits (fog cannot start past ~2 500 units, far plane ≤ 12 800). |

**Exit value** — one of:

- a string naming an entrance: a vanilla entrance enum name (`"ENTR_HYRULE_FIELD_0"`, or a
  dynamic return entrance such as `"ENTR_RETURN_GROTTO"`) or a custom entrance
  `"<scene id>/<entrance id>"` from §7.1. A string that is not a registered name and not
  an integer in the §2 string form makes the document **rejected**;
- a non-negative JSON integer (the §2 boolean and fractional forms are not accepted here): an
  index into the entrance table. Only an index that is the same for every player may be written as
  a number — below `ENTR_MAX` (1556), or one of the dynamic return entrances 0x7FF9–0x7FFF
  (grottos, fairy fountains, the shooting gallery, the Bazaar). **A number in between is
  rejected**: that is the range the game hands out custom entrances from, and which number a given
  custom entrance gets depends on the player's mod stack, so a custom entrance is addressed by
  name or not at all.

Any other JSON type makes the document **rejected**.

**Transition-actor entry**

```json
{ "id": 9, "pos": [0, 0, 0], "rotY": 0, "params": 0,
  "front": { "room": 0, "effects": 0 }, "back": { "room": 1, "effects": 0 } }
```

`room` is a room number, `-1` = none. Transition actors are identified by their position in this
list; the index is not read from `params` for actors spawned from this list, and `params` bits
10–15 **must** be 0. `id` is 13-bit. There is no limit of 64.

**Material-animation entry**

The data-driven form of what a vanilla scene draw config does in C (and what Majora's Mask
declares in its scene header): every frame, a small display list is generated from the entry and
bound to a runtime segment; a room display list that calls that segment
(`gsSPDisplayList(0x08000000 | 1)`) right before its triangles inherits the result.

```json
"materialAnims": {
  "0": { "segment": 8, "pass": "opa", "type": "texScroll",
         "layers": [ { "xStep": 0, "yStep": 1, "width": 32, "height": 32 } ] },
  "1": { "segment": 9, "pass": "xlu", "type": "twoTexScroll",
         "layers": [ { "xStep": 0, "yStep": 1, "width": 32, "height": 32 },
                     { "xStep": 0, "yStep": 1, "width": 32, "height": 32 } ] },
  "2": { "segment": 10, "pass": "both", "type": "colorLerp",
         "length": 64, "keyFrames": [0, 32, 64],
         "primColors": [[255,255,255,255,0], [200,80,0,255,128], [255,255,255,255,0]],
         "envColors":  [[0,0,0,255], [60,0,0,255], [0,0,0,255]] },
  "3": { "segment": 11, "pass": "opa", "type": "texCycle",
         "textures": ["textures/mymod/lava_a", "textures/mymod/lava_b"],
         "frames": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] }
}
```

The entry list is positional (a layer may patch one entry); the lists *inside* an entry
(`layers`, `keyFrames`, `primColors`, `envColors`, `textures`, `frames`) are JSON arrays and
replace whole (§3.3).

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `segment` | int 8–13 | The runtime segment bound. Outside the range the entry is **rejected** (logged and dropped); the document still loads. |
| `pass` | `"opa"`, `"xlu"` or `"both"` | Which display buffer the bind is written to; default `"both"`. Any other value rejects the entry. |
| `type` | one of `texScroll`, `twoTexScroll`, `color`, `colorLerp`, `colorNonLinear`, `texCycle` | Any other value rejects the entry. |
| `layers` | array of `{ xStep, yStep, width, height }` ints, plus optional `xSpeed`, `ySpeed` numbers | Scroll types only: exactly 1 layer for `texScroll`, exactly 2 for `twoTexScroll` (render tile 0, then tile 1); any other count rejects the entry. `xStep`/`yStep` −128…127 are quarter-texels per gameplay frame; `width`/`height` 1–255 are the tile size the generated list sets. These ranges are writer requirements (§2): a value outside wraps in the byte. `xSpeed`/`ySpeed` are numbers (§2, may be fractional; default 0) in the same unit and are **added** to the steps, so a layer can move slower than one quarter-texel per frame: `{ "xStep": 0, "xSpeed": 0.1 }` is a tenth of a quarter-texel per frame, `{ "xStep": 1, "xSpeed": 0.5 }` is 1.5. A speed a 32-bit float cannot hold as a finite number reads as missing. At gameplay frame *f* the tile offset is ((`xStep` + `xSpeed`)·*f*, −(`yStep` + `ySpeed`)·*f*) modulo 32 768 quarter-texels (8192 texels), evaluated without accumulation, so a fractional rate does not drift. The wrap is seamless on a texture whose width and height are powers of two up to 8192 texels. |
| `length` | int 1–65 535 | Colour types: the cycle length in frames; the frame counter is taken modulo it. A value outside the range rejects the entry. |
| `keyFrames` | array of ints | Colour types: ascending frame numbers, the first `0`, 1–50 entries (the non-linear path holds 50). A list that is empty, longer than 50, not ascending, or not starting at `0` rejects the entry. Each value is stored 16-bit (§2). |
| `primColors` | array of `[r, g, b, a, lodFrac]` | Colour types: one per key frame; `lodFrac` feeds the primitive LOD fraction. `color` holds each colour until the next key frame, `colorLerp` interpolates linearly between neighbouring key frames, `colorNonLinear` evaluates the Lagrange polynomial through all of them. Frames at or after the last key frame hold its colour (`color`, `colorLerp`) or continue the polynomial (`colorNonLinear`); `length` past the last key frame is a pause. A count that differs from `keyFrames` rejects the entry. |
| `envColors` | array of `[r, g, b, a]`, or absent | Colour types: one per key frame; absent leaves the environment colour alone. A count that differs from `keyFrames` rejects the entry. |
| `textures` | array of texture paths | `texCycle` only; every element a string (any other JSON type rejects the entry), at most 65 536 entries. |
| `frames` | array of ints | `texCycle` only: one index into `textures` per frame; its length is the cycle length, 1–65 535 entries. An index out of range, or a list that is empty or too long, rejects the entry. |

A material that uses a scroll entry **must** load its texture with wrap addressing and set up its
tile(s) before calling the segment: the generated list only sets tile sizes. A two-layer scroll
expects render tiles 0 and 1 both loaded (a two-cycle blend). Vanilla water display lists have
exactly this shape.

### 4.3 `rooms/<n>.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "unbound/room/1",
  "setups": { "0": { … } }
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `setups` | as in §4.2 | Every setup complete. |

Room mesh vertices are absolute world coordinates (they draw under the identity matrix); a
mesh that leaves the `s16` range uses the v1 vertex resource (§8.1).

A room setup holds:

Every key is optional (as in §4.2, an absent key emits no command).

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `behavior` | `{ gameplayFlags, gameplayFlags2 }` ints | |
| `echo` | int | |
| `time` | `{ hour, minute, increment }` ints | default 255 = unset |
| `skyboxModifier` | `{ skyboxDisabled, sunMoonDisabled }` ints | |
| `wind` | `{ west, vertical, south, speed }` ints | |
| `objects` | positional list of object ids | The object bank has 1 024 slots shared with the 2–3 always-loaded keep objects; entries that do not fit are dropped with an error. Any id is accepted, including ids beyond the vanilla object table (the engine loads nothing for them; actor code names its own assets). |
| `lights` | positional list of light entries (below) | |
| `actors` | **keyed list** of actor entries (below) | spawn order = `$order`, then key sort order |
| `mesh` | mesh object (below) | |

**Light entry** — `type` 1: directional `{ type: 1, dir: direction vector, color }`; `type` 0
or 2: point light `{ type, pos: vec, color, glow: int 0–255, radius: int −32768…32767 }`. Any
other `type` makes the document **rejected**.

**Actor entry** — `{ id: int or name, pos: vec, rot: vec, params: int }`. Keys are opaque identity
strings; the converter uses the vanilla list index as the key. `params` is the vanilla packed word
for that actor type. The number of actors per room is limited only by the live-actor cap (§9).

`id` is an integer (§2) **or an actor name**: a string that is not an integer in the §2 string form
names an actor type, either one registered in `unbound/actors/` (§7.2) or an actor the game
already knows by name (vanilla names such as `En_Kanban`, and actors a build adds in code). An
entry whose name is not known is skipped with an error, and the rest of the list loads. A name
changes nothing else about the actor: a vanilla actor placed by name still needs its object in the
room's `objects`, as when it is placed by number. A declared type (§7.2) needs none.

An integer `id` must be from 0 to `0xFFF`. Numbers from `0x1000` up are assigned to registered
types at load and change with the mounted mods, and a negative number names no actor, so an entry
that uses either is skipped with an error; custom types are placed by name.

Names are accepted in room `actors` only; spawns and transition actors keep integer ids. A
transition actor whose `id` is a name, or a number outside 0–`0xFFF`, does not spawn, with an
error; it keeps its place in the list, whose indices other data refers to.

`params` as an object is reserved for named arguments in a later version. An entry whose `params`
is an object is skipped with an error.

**Mesh object**

| `type` | Shape |
|---|---|
| `0` | `{ "type": 0, "entries": positional list of { "opa": path or null, "xlu": path or null } }` |
| `1` | `{ "type": 1, "format": 1 or 2, "opa": path or null, "xlu": path or null, "image": image }` (format 1) or `"images": positional list of image` (format 2; ≤ 255 images, more → the document is **rejected**). `image` = `{ source: path, tlut: int, width, height, fmt, siz, mode0, tlutCount: ints, unk0C: int, id: int, unk00: int }`; `id`/`unk00` are meaningful only for format 2. Any other `format` makes the document **rejected**. |
| `2` | `{ "type": 2, "entries": positional list of { "pos": vec, "radius": number, "opa": path or null, "xlu": path or null } }`. `radius` is a world-unit cull radius, unbounded. ≤ 1 024 entries; extra entries are not drawn (§9). |

Type-0 entry count is unbounded. Any other `type` makes the document **rejected**.

### 4.4 `collision.json` + `collision.bin`

```json
{
  "$schema": "unbound/collision/3",
  "bounds": { "min": [x,y,z], "max": [x,y,z] },
  "bulk": { "file": "scenes/spot00/collision.bin", "vertices": 1832, "polys": 2410 },
  "surfaceTypes": { "0": { … } },
  "cameras": { "0": { "sType": 1, "count": 0, "positionIndex": null } },
  "cameraPositions": { "0": [x,y,z] },
  "waterBoxes": { "0": { … } }
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bounds.min`, `bounds.max` | vector | world-unit collision bounds |
| `bulk.file` | path | the `collision.bin` (highest layer wins, never merged) |
| `bulk.vertices`, `bulk.polys` | int | counts in the bulk file; the file **must** be at least the size §4.4.1 implies |
| `surfaceTypes` | positional list | referenced by polygon `type` |
| `cameras` | positional list of `{ sType: int, count: int, positionIndex: int or null }` | `positionIndex` is the first of `count` consecutive `cameraPositions` entries the camera uses (position, rotation, fov/flags triples, as vanilla); `null` or a negative value = none; an index at or beyond the list reads `[0,0,0]`. `positionIndex + count` **must not** exceed the list. `sType` is 16-bit; `count` is a signed 16-bit value |
| `cameraPositions` | positional list of vectors | **integers −32768…32767** (a remaining vanilla limit, §9; the reader does not validate) |
| `waterBoxes` | positional list | ≤ 65 535 entries; more → the document is **rejected** |

**Surface type** — every field is an integer; all are unpacked (nothing is a bit-packed word):

| Field | Range | Field | Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `camera` | index into `cameras`, unbounded | `material` | 0–15 |
| `exit` | **1-based** index into the setup's `exits` (`exit` N selects `exits["N−1"]`), unbounded; 0 = none | `floorEffect` | 0–3 |
| `floorType` | 0–31 | `lightSetting` | index into `lighting` (§4.2) |
| `wallFlags` | 0–7 | `echo` | 0–63 |
| `wallType` | 0–31 | `canHookshot` | 0/1 |
| `floorProperty` | 0–15 | `conveyorSpeed` | 0–7 |
| `isSoft` | 0/1 | `conveyorDirection` | 0–63 |
| `isHorseBlocked` | 0/1 | `isWallDamage` | 0/1 |

**Water box**

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `xMin`, `ySurface`, `zMin`, `xLength`, `zLength` | integer | world units, unbounded (a fractional value is rounded) |
| `camera` | int | index into `cameras` |
| `lightSetting` | int 0–254 | index into `lighting`; 31 = none (the vanilla sentinel, read as 0) |
| `room` | int | room number the box belongs to; `-1` = every room. Default when absent: `-1`. |
| `notSwimmable` | 0/1 | vanilla property bit 19: the box is excluded from the swim-surface query and found only by the ripple-effect query |

#### 4.4.1 `collision.bin`

Little-endian, no header, exactly two arrays back to back, for `$schema` `unbound/collision/3`:

| Vertex | Polygon |
|---|---|
| `s32 x, y, z` (12 bytes) | `u16 type; u16 pad; u32 vA; u32 vB; u32 vC; s16 nx; s16 ny; s16 nz; s16 pad; s32 dist` (28 bytes) |

Collision is integral so that a scene's geometry means exactly what its author placed — an editor
snapping to whole units gets back what it wrote, with no seam where two surfaces that should meet
are a fraction apart.

`dist` is derived from a unit normal, so it is fractional even when every vertex is integral. The
writer rounds it, which displaces a plane by at most half a unit — the same error vanilla accepted
when it stored `dist` in an `s16`.

Polygon fields: `type` indexes `surfaceTypes` (a header holds at most 65 535 surface types);
`vA`, `vB`, `vC` are vertex words: bits 0–28 the vertex index, bits 29–31 flags (`vA`: xpFlags;
`vB`: bit 29 = conveyor, bits 30–31 reserved, write 0; `vC`: reserved, write 0); `nx, ny, nz`
the unit normal scaled by 32767; `dist` the plane distance from the world origin. Vertex and
polygon counts are unbounded (indices are 29-bit); bytes past the declared counts are ignored.
A `$schema` that is absent, whose type is not `unbound/collision`, or whose version is not 3 is
**rejected** (1 and 2 were pre-release layouts; see §10).

### 4.5 `paths/<name>.json`

```json
{ "$schema": "unbound/paths/1", "paths": { "0": { "points": [ [x,y,z], … ] } } }
```

`paths` is a positional list; `points` is an array of vectors (numbers). A path holds at most
**255 points** (§9); longer paths are truncated and an error is logged. `<name>` is any file
name; a scene refers to the document by its full path (§4.2).

## 5. Text

```
text/<lang>/messages.json          $schema unbound/text/1     lang ∈ eng, ger, fra, jpn, staff
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "unbound/text/1",
  "messages": {
    "0x0F12": { "box": 0, "ypos": 0, "text": "…" },
    "0x0071": null
  }
}
```

- `messages` **must** be an object (keyed list); any other type is an error and the table is
  empty. The key is the message id (integer 0–65534, written as a decimal or `0x` hex string; the
  converter writes `0x` and four upper-case hex digits). `0xFFFF` is the table terminator; an
  entry whose key is `0xFFFF`, negative, above 65534, or not an integer is skipped with an error.
  A `null` value deletes the id (§3.2). An entry that is neither an object nor `null` is skipped.
- `box`: textbox type 0–15 (high nibble); `ypos`: textbox y-position 0–15 (low nibble); the
  reader does not validate.
- `text`: required — an entry without a string `text` is skipped with an error. The raw message
  bytes as a JSON string in which each code point U+0000–U+00FF is one byte (control codes are
  written as JSON escapes). The message terminator byte `0x02` is appended if absent. Code points
  above U+00FF have no byte form; each becomes `?` and a warning is logged.
- The document carries no language key; the folder is the language. `$schema` is
  self-description for tools and is not otherwise interpreted.
- Ids may be added freely; a message table has no fixed size. A single message may be up to
  8 192 bytes; a longer one is truncated with an error. One decoded textbox is limited to
  1 024 bytes (§9).

Vanilla text resources (`text/<lang>_message_data_static/…`) and the vanilla `override/`
mechanism are still accepted; when `text/<lang>/messages.json` exists in any layer it is the base
table for that language, the vanilla resource is not read, and `override/` entries are applied on
top of it. The folder name for English is `eng` only.

## 6. Manifest — `unbound.json`

```json
{
  "format": "unbound",
  "formatVersion": 2,
  "game": "oot",
  "source": { "romHash": "0xEC7011B7", "converter": "soh Ackbar Delta (9.2.3) unbound r1" },
  "features": ["scenes", "collision", "text", "paths"],
  "requires": { "formatVersion": 2 }
}
```

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | yes (writer) | the string `"unbound"`; a reader does not interpret it |
| `formatVersion` | yes (writer) | integer; this document describes version **2**, the only value a reader accepts. An absent value is read as 2. |
| `game` | no | `"oot"` |
| `source` | no | provenance of a converted archive; free-form |
| `features` | base: yes | list of the document kinds the layer provides. A layer whose `features` contains `"scenes"` is a base archive (§1.3); a layer that does not provide every vanilla scene **must not** list it. |
| `requires.formatVersion` | no | the minimum reader version the layer needs; default = `formatVersion` |

Manifests are read per layer, not merged. A layer whose `formatVersion` or
`requires.formatVersion` is not the reader's version, or whose manifest is not a JSON
object, is logged as an error and does not count as an Unbound base archive; its files are **not**
removed from the layer merge.

## 7. Registries

Mods add scenes, entrances and actor types by declaring them in registry documents. The game assigns every
number; everything else addresses them by name.

### 7.1 Scenes and entrances — `unbound/scenes.json`

One layer-merged document (§3), keyed by scene id:

```json
{
  "mymod/lava_temple": {
    "name": "Lava Temple",
    "scene": "scenes/mymod/lava_temple/scene.json",
    "drawConfig": 0,
    "titleCardTexture": "textures/mymod/lava_temple_title",
    "horse": { "pos": [100, 0, -200], "angle": 0 },
    "entrances": {
      "main": { "spawn": 0, "showTitleCard": true, "continueBgm": false,
                "endTransition": 2, "startTransition": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Required | Type / meaning |
|---|---|---|
| key | — | scene id: any unique, non-empty string that is not a vanilla scene enum name. It is also the key under which the scene's saved flags are stored. An entry that is not an object is ignored. |
| `name` | no | display name; default = the key |
| `scene` | yes | path of the scene resource: a `scene.json` (§4.2) or a vanilla-format scene resource. An entry without it is **rejected**. |
| `sceneId` | **deprecated** | **Ignored**, with a warning. A scene's numeric id is assigned by the game: one more than the highest registered so far, starting at 128, in registry order. Two mods that pinned the same id used to collide, and the loser did not load at all. |
| `drawConfig` | no | scene draw config 0–(vanilla count − 1); out of range → rejected entry |
| `titleCardTexture` | no | path of a texture shown when an entrance has `showTitleCard` |
| `entrances` | no | keyed list; the key is the entrance id, and the entrance is addressable everywhere as `"<scene id>/<entrance id>"`. A rejected entrance does not reject its scene. |
| `entrances.*.index` | **deprecated** | **Ignored**, with a warning. The entrance's 4-entry layer group is assigned by the game: the group after the highest registered so far, in registry order, up to 0x7FF4. Two mods that pinned the same index used to collide, and the loser's entrance did not register — leaving its scene with no way in. A custom entrance is addressed everywhere by name, so a vanilla-format scene resource cannot exit into one. |
| `entrances.*.spawn` | no | index into the scene's `spawns`, 0–127; default 0 |
| `entrances.*.showTitleCard`, `continueBgm` | no | booleans/0-1; default false |
| `entrances.*.endTransition`, `startTransition` | no | transition type ints; default 2 |
| `entrances.*.layers` | reserved | not read in version 1; present → warning |
| `horse` | no | **Epona.** Its presence lets her into the scene: she may be ridden in through a scene transition, parked here, and — once she is in the scene — summoned with Epona's Song. An object (below), or a boolean/0-1 — `true` allows her with nowhere to wait. Absent or `false`, the scene refuses her, as every scene but vanilla's five does. |
| `horse.pos` | no | vec: where she waits when she is neither parked here nor ridden in. Absent, the scene has no idle spot and she is only ever here because the player brought her — and Epona's Song does nothing, since the song calls a horse that is already in the scene rather than creating one. A malformed `pos` is ignored with a log line and the scene keeps the permission. |
| `horse.angle` | no | int: her facing at `horse.pos`; default 0 |

Vanilla's five horse scenes (Hyrule Field, Lake Hylia, Gerudo Valley, Gerudo's Fortress, Lon Lon
Ranch) behave as though they carried `horse`, and are otherwise untouched. A **custom** scene that
allows her is given Epona's object in every one of its rooms whether or not its rooms list it. She
stays adult-only, as in vanilla.

A registered entrance occupies four consecutive entrance-table entries (child-day, child-night,
adult-day, adult-night), all identical in version 1.

Entries are registered in the merged document's key order (§3.5): `$order` first, then key sort
order. Rejected entries are skipped; the remaining entries still register.

Vanilla scenes are always registered under their enum names (`SCENE_HYRULE_FIELD`); vanilla
entrances under theirs (`ENTR_HYRULE_FIELD_0`). Both name forms are valid exit values (§4.2).

### 7.2 Actor types — `unbound/actors/<name>.json`

One document per actor type; each document is one registry entry. Every path in any mounted archive
that starts with `unbound/actors/` and ends with `.json` declares a type, and the part between is
the type's **name**: `unbound/actors/mymod/old_man.json` declares `mymod/old_man`. Folders are
allowed at any depth and the name is case-sensitive.

The name must not be empty, must not be an integer in the §2 string form (a room actor's `id`
would read it as a number), and must not be an actor name the game already knows (vanilla names
such as `En_Kanban`, and actors SoH or a build adds in code); a name that breaks one of these
**rejects the entry**. Writers should keep their types in a folder of their own
(`unbound/actors/mymod/…`) so that two mods cannot declare the same name.

Each path is layer-merged on its own (§3). A later layer patches another mod's type by carrying a
document at the same path with only the keys it changes, and a layer whose document is `null`
removes the type. A merged document that is not an object is skipped with an error; a document
that is not parsable JSON in one layer is skipped as §3.2 says. A problem in one type's document
never affects another type. Like §7.1, the documents carry no `$schema`.

| Key | Required | Type / meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | no | display name; default = the type's name |
| `model` | yes | object (below). An entry without one is **rejected**. |
| `collision` | no | object (below); absent = the actor has no collision and can be walked through |
| `talk` | no | object (below); absent = the actor cannot be targeted or talked to |
| `look` | no | object (below): the head turns to follow the player. Needs a `model.skeleton`; on a static model it **rejects the entry**. |
| any other key | — | **rejects the entry**. Keys this version does not define are reserved for later versions (`base`, `params`, `script`). A build that predates a key therefore rejects the type, and its placements are skipped as unknown names, instead of spawning an actor without the behavior. The same rule holds inside `model`, `collision`, `talk` and `look`: a key none of the tables below lists rejects the entry. |

**`model`** — exactly one of `skeleton` (an animated model) or `displayList` (a static model);
both, or neither, **rejects the entry**.

| Key | Type / meaning |
|---|---|
| `skeleton` | path of a skeleton resource, normal or flex, with standard or LOD limbs. A curve skeleton, or one with skin limbs (Epona's), is not supported: actors of the type do not spawn and an error is logged. |
| `animation` | path of an animation for `skeleton`, with the skeleton's limb count. Required with `skeleton`: absent **rejects the entry**, because an OoT skeleton has no usable rest pose (with every joint angle zero it folds up). An animation for fewer limbs than the skeleton has, or one with no frames, stops actors of the type from spawning, with an error. For a still model, hold one frame with `frame`. Ignored with `displayList`. |
| `frame` | number: when present, the animation is held on this frame (a pose), clamped to the animation's first and last frames; absent, the animation loops |
| `speed` | number: playback rate for a looping animation, in frames per update; default 1. Clamped to the animation's length either way (negative plays backwards). |
| `displayList` | path of a display list: the whole model, drawn as it is |
| `translucent` | boolean: draw in the translucent pass instead of the opaque one, for models with real transparency (glass, ghosts, water). Default false. Cut-out transparency such as leaves and fences does not need it: the display list's own render mode handles that in the opaque pass. The model's own render mode decides whether it blends: a vanilla character model, which sets an opaque mode, is only sorted with the translucent pass and does not turn see-through. |
| `scale` | positive number; default 0.01 (the scale of most vanilla NPCs). Zero or a negative number **rejects the entry**. |
| `yOffset` | number: model-space vertical offset, applied before scale; default 0 |
| `segments` | object: key a segment number 8–12 as a §2 integer string, value a texture path, bound before the model draws (NPC eye and mouth textures). Any other key, and a value that is not a non-empty string, is ignored with an error. A path that is not a texture stops actors of the type from spawning, as any other path does. A segment 8–12 the type does not name is bound to an empty display list, which is what vanilla binds on the segment many character models call to set their render mode. The environment colour is opaque black while the model draws. |
| `hideLimbs` | array of integers: limbs, numbered as `look.limb` is, whose own mesh is not drawn; their child limbs still draw. Vanilla character code hides spare hands and props it swaps in (Malon's limbs 2 and 5, child Zelda's 3–6). Entries below 1, or past the skeleton's last limb, are ignored with an error. |
| `shadow` | number: size of a round ground shadow, on the scale vanilla NPCs give theirs (child Malon 18, the carpenter 42); default 0 = none. It does not change with `scale`: the same value draws the same shadow on any model. The shadow is drawn on the floor under the actor's position when it spawns, when that floor is scene collision (not a moving platform) and at most 50 units above or 500 below it. |
| `cullRadius` | number, world units: how far the model reaches from the actor's position. The game stops drawing an actor whose position is off screen by more than about 350 units, which cuts off larger models at the screen edge; a larger `cullRadius` widens that margin. Default 0 = the game's default; a negative value reads as 0. |
| `drawDistance` | number, world units: the actor stops drawing (and updating) beyond about this distance in front of the camera, plus `cullRadius`. Default 1000, the game's default; 0 or a negative value reads as the default. |

Asset paths are resolved when the first actor of the type spawns, not when the registry loads. A
path that does not resolve stops every actor of the type from spawning, with one error; it does not
reject the type, so its placements are not unknown names.

A path may name a vanilla asset or one the mod ships itself, at any path in its archive (§1.4).
Mod-supplied display lists, vertex arrays, textures, skeletons and animations are ordinary SoH
resources of the same types vanilla objects use, as room meshes already are (§4.3). Writers
should keep them under a path of their own (`objects/<mod>/…`) and never under `alt/`. For a
model the mod ships:

- Vertices are in **model space** around the actor's origin, and `scale` converts them to world
  units. A room mesh is exported in world units, so the same geometry placed as an actor needs
  `scale` 1, or coordinates exported larger to match a smaller `scale`.
- The display list sets up its own render state (render mode, combiner, geometry mode, textures),
  as a room mesh's does. The actor sets only the matrix and the segments in `segments`.
- Whether the model is lit is the display list's choice: with normals and lighting enabled it is
  lit like vanilla actors; with vertex colours and lighting off it is shaded like room geometry,
  which matches the scene around it.

**`collision`** — a solid cylinder the player cannot pass through.

| Key | Type / meaning |
|---|---|
| `radius`, `height` | integers, world units; default 0 (a zero radius or height means no collision) |
| `yShift` | integer: vertical offset of the cylinder's base; default 0 |

**`talk`**

| Key | Type / meaning |
|---|---|
| `message` | integer message id 0–65534 (§5): the default text. Default 0 = none, in which case only placements that set `params` talk. A value outside the range reads as 0, with an error. |
| `range` | number: talk range in world units; default 50 + `collision.radius` (vanilla's default). A negative value reads as 0. |

The message shown is `params` (read as unsigned 16-bit) when it is non-zero and not `0xFFFF`,
otherwise `talk.message`. When both are zero the actor cannot be talked to. A message that does
not exist shows whatever the game shows for a missing id, as with any actor.

**`look`** — the head turns toward the player, within the neck's limits, as vanilla NPCs do.

| Key | Type / meaning |
|---|---|
| `limb` | integer: the head limb, numbered as vanilla limb-draw code numbers limbs (the root limb is 1; vanilla NPC heads are usually 15). Required: absent, or not a limb of the skeleton, the actor spawns without head tracking and an error is logged. |
| `pivot` | number: distance along `turnAxis`, in model units, from the limb's origin to the point the head turns about. Default 0, the limb's origin, which is the neck on vanilla rigs. |
| `range` | number: the head follows the player within this distance, in world units, and while talking; outside it the head returns to rest. Default 200. A negative value reads as 0. |
| `turnAxis` | `[x, y, z]`: the axis, in the head limb's own space, the head turns about to follow the player left and right; a positive turn rotates by the right-hand rule about it. Default `[1, 0, 0]`, the limb's X axis. |
| `nodAxis` | `[x, y, z]`: the axis, in the same space, the head nods about to follow the player up and down. Default `[0, 0, 1]`, the limb's Z axis. |

The head turns, then nods, about axes of the limb's own space, around the point `pivot` along
`turnAxis`. The defaults are how vanilla character rigs are built (turning about the limb's X axis,
which runs up the neck, and nodding about its Z axis); a skeleton made another way, such as one
imported from another game whose head X axis points forward, sets the axes it was built with. Each
axis is normalized, so only its direction counts. An axis that is not an array of three numbers or
has zero length, or two axes that are parallel (less than about 0.06° apart, after the defaults
apply), leaves the actor without head tracking and log an error, as a bad `limb` does; the type
still registers. Writers should omit an axis equal to its default, since a reader without these
keys rejects the type (the "any other key" row above).

When `look` is present, the actor's focus point (where the targeting arrow sits and the camera
looks while talking) is its head. Otherwise it is the top of the collision cylinder, or the
actor's position when it has no collision.

A registered type gets an actor id assigned by the game, in byte order of the type names. The number
depends on which mods are mounted and must never be written by a tool; types are addressed by
name only.

## 8. Vanilla-format resources under Unbound

Every vanilla resource type still loads. These vanilla encodings are reinterpreted:

| Resource | Difference |
|---|---|
| Binary collision header | Polygon vertex words `u16`: bits 0–12 index, bits 13–15 flags — unpacked to the 29-bit form. `dist` is read as signed 16-bit. Surface types and water boxes are unpacked as in §4.4. |
| XML collision header | `VertexA/B/C` are plain indices when the element carries `XpFlags` (0–7) and/or `Conveyor` (0/1) attributes; otherwise they are the packed vanilla words. Surface `Data1`/`Data2` and water-box `Properties` are the packed words. |
| XML collision header, names | XML `Data1`/`Data2` are the vanilla `data0`/`data1` words (the XML names are off by one from the binary field names, as in vanilla SoH). |
| Binary/XML scene commands | Binary transition-actor rooms are read as signed 8-bit (`0xFF` = −1) and entrance rooms as unsigned 8-bit; XML room attributes are read as signed integers. Positions are widened to numbers. Object lists may hold up to 1024 ids; actor and room counts are 16-bit. |
| Binary `SetMesh` | Mesh entry count stays an 8-bit field (≤ 255). The XML `PolyNum` count and JSON rooms are not limited by it. |
| Binary/XML text tables | Unchanged; may be overridden per id by `override/…` as vanilla; superseded by §5 when present. |
| Matrix resources | Stored fixed-point as vanilla; unpacked to float on load. |
| Vertex arrays (v0) | Stored as vanilla: an `OARR` array of type 25 (Vertex) holding 16-byte records with `s16` positions. Positions are widened to `s32` on load. See §8.1 for the wider v1 form. |

### 8.1 Vertex resource v1 — `s32` positions

Room meshes draw under the identity matrix, so their vertices are world coordinates. The vanilla
vertex record stores them as `s16`, which caps one mesh at 65 535 units across however large the
world is. This format adds a second encoding of the same resource.

A **vertex array** is an `OARR` resource (type `0x4F415252`, SoH's generic array) whose first
word is arrayType 25 (Vertex), followed by a `u32` count — that is how every vertex in the game is
stored; the dedicated `OVTX` vertex resource is unused by OoT but accepts the same two versions.
The record encoding is selected by the version field of the resource header. A reader **must**
support both.

| Version | Record | Positions |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 16 bytes | `s16` — the vanilla form; still what the converter passes through |
| 1 | 22 bytes | `s32` |

Version 1 record, in order, little-endian, **not padded**:

| Field | Type | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `x`, `y`, `z` | `s32` × 3 | 12 |
| `flag` | `u16` | 2 |
| `s`, `t` | `s16` × 2 | 4 |
| `r`, `g`, `b`, `a` | `u8` × 4 | 4 |

Both versions are preceded by `u32 arrayType = 25` and the `u32` vertex count, as in vanilla. An
`OARR` of any other arrayType at version 1 is **rejected** (only the Vertex type is defined at v1).

**Offsets into a vertex resource are byte offsets, in units of that resource's own record size.**
An exported display list addresses a vertex group by the byte distance from the start of the
resource, so the divisor that recovers an element index is 16 for v0 and 22 for v1 — and is
*never* the reader's in-memory vertex struct, which is padded and may be wider still. A writer
must compute offsets against the record size of the version it is emitting.

A writer **should** emit v1 only for a mesh that needs it; v0 is smaller and every vanilla mesh
fits it.

**Boundary.** This applies to vertices reached through a vertex resource, which is how room meshes
and object display lists are addressed. Vertices reached through a *segment* — the Skin system's
runtime buffer, and the display lists that read it — are always the vanilla 16-byte form, because
there is no resource to carry a record size. A v1 mesh therefore cannot back a skinned limb.

## 9. Limits

Limits lifted relative to vanilla (the format imposes none of these):

| Quantity | Vanilla | Unbound |
|---|---|---|
| Scenes / entrances | 110 / 1556 fixed tables | registry (§7.1); ids and indices ≤ 32 767 |
| Rooms per scene | 255 (127 addressable, 32 with clear flags) | 32 767 |
| Objects per room setup | 128 | 1 024 bank slots (shared with the keep objects) |
| Actors per room; live actors | 255 / 255 (wrapping) | 65 535 / 8 192 |
| Transition actors per scene | 64 | 32 767 |
| Mesh entries per room | 255 (type 2: 64 drawn) | type 0 unbounded; type 2 ≤ 1 024; type-1 images ≤ 255 |
| Collision vertices / polygons | 8 191 / 32 767 | 2²⁹ / unbounded |
| Dyna (moving-collision) actors, polys, verts | 50 / 512 / 512 | unbounded |
| Exits, cameras per scene (surface-type fields) | 31 / 255 | unbounded |
| Light settings per setup | 31 (surface field) | 255 |
| Water-box room | ≤ 63 | any room |
| World extent (any position) | ±32 760 | f32; positions within ±1 048 576 (2²⁰) keep a precision of 0.0625 or better |
| One room mesh | every vertex within ±32 767; ≤ 65 535 units across | `s32` vertices (§8.1); a room mesh may span the whole world extent |
| Floor "none" sentinel | −32 000 | −2 147 483 648 |
| Fog start / far plane | ~2 500 / 12 800 | world units, unbounded (lighting entry) |
| Message ids | fixed table | unbounded; message ≤ 8 192 bytes |
| Actor types | fixed table | registry (§7.2) |

Limits that remain (validation targets for tools):

| Quantity | Limit | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `cameraPositions` components | −32 768…32 767 | scene camera data is still 16-bit |
| Cutscene camera points | −32 768…32 767 | cutscene command words |
| Path points | ≤ 255 per path | the point count of a path is a byte |
| Decoded textbox | ≤ 1 024 bytes | decode buffer; not guarded |
| Light settings per setup | ≤ 255 | the light-setting count and index are bytes |
| Surface types per collision header | ≤ 65 535 | polygon `type` is 16-bit |
| Water boxes per collision header | ≤ 65 535 | count is 16-bit |
| Scene ids; entrance indices | ≤ 32 767 | entrance table and exit list are signed 16-bit |
| Transition actors per scene | ≤ 32 767 | the actor's list index is signed 16-bit |
| Custom actor types | ≤ 28 672 per mounted set | actor ids are signed 16-bit and custom types are numbered from 0x1000 |
| Mesh type-2 entries per room | ≤ 1 024 | sort buffer |
| Mesh type-1 images per room | ≤ 255 | count is a byte |
| Rooms with a minimap "visited" bit | < 32 | vanilla save layout |
| Entrance layers | 4 identical per custom entrance | `layers` reserved |
| Minimap / pause map for custom scenes | none | |
| Binary `SetMesh` entries | ≤ 255 | legacy encoding only |
| Room numbers in a vanilla-format scene | −1…127 | signed byte |
| Material-animation segments | 6 per display pass (`segment` 8–13) | the runtime segment table; materials may share a segment. The window is a libultraship table size, not a format limit |

## 10. Versioning

- `formatVersion` in `unbound.json` and the `/<n>` suffix of every `$schema` are the version of
  this specification. Version 2 is described here and is the only version a reader accepts.
- **Version 1** was a pre-release format (float collision as `unbound/collision/1` and `/2`, a
  per-room mesh `origin`, packed `data0`/`data1` and `properties` legacy forms, `s16`-only vertex
  resources). No archives of it are supported: a version-1 manifest, and the `/1` and `/2`
  collision schemas, are **rejected**. The `$schema` numbers were not reset so that such an
  archive fails loudly instead of being misread.
- A change that makes a valid version-2 archive read differently, or makes a document this text
  calls accepted be rejected, is a breaking change and requires version 3.
- Adding an optional key with a zero default is not breaking and is recorded here under version 2.
  Version-2 additions so far: `sound.song` (§4.2, 2026-09-02); `materialAnims` (§4.2, 2026-09-05);
  `horse` (§7.1, 2026-09-16); scroll-layer `xSpeed`/`ySpeed` (§4.2, 2026-09-17); the actor
  registry `unbound/actors/<name>.json` and actor names in a room actor's `id` (§7.2, §4.3, 2026-09-26);
  `look.turnAxis` and `look.nodAxis` (§7.2, 2026-09-26; a reader without them rejects a type that
  sets them, so they are written only when they differ from the defaults).
  With the registry, a room or transition actor's integer `id` outside 0–`0xFFF` is skipped
  (§4.3): numbers from `0x1000` up named no actor before, and a negative one never did, so no
  valid document changes meaning.
- Version-2 clarifications (2026-09-06, `materialAnims`): the per-entry **rejected** rules for
  `length`, `keyFrames`, `primColors`, `textures` and `frames` are now stated in §4.2; each guards
  the reader's storage (a modulus, fixed arrays, 16-bit indices). No document within the ranges
  §4.2 already gave is affected. The scroll `layers` ranges wrap as §2 always said (an earlier
  reader rejected them). The hold-past-the-last-key-frame behaviour of the colour types is stated.
- Version-2 behaviour change (2026-09-17, `materialAnims` scroll): the tile offset wraps at 32 768
  quarter-texels instead of 2048 (§4.2). A texture whose width and height are powers of two up to
  512 texels, the only kind the old period wrapped seamlessly, draws identically; a larger or
  non-power-of-two texture already jumped at each wrap and now jumps less often or not at all. No
  document changes meaning and none is rejected, so this is recorded here and not as version 3.
- Version-2 clarification (2026-09-20, `sound`): `seq` and `natureAmbience` have stated ranges
  (§4.2) and an out-of-range value reads as "none" instead of wrapping, since the wrapped byte
  crashed the audio thread. No document within the ranges changes meaning and none is rejected.
- Version-2 note (2026-09-26, actor names): a reader older than the actor registry reads a string
  `id` as the wrong type, which §2 treats as missing: id 0, the player actor. A scene that places an
  actor by name therefore spawns an extra Link on those readers instead of being refused, and
  `requires.formatVersion` cannot prevent it, because a layer that fails the version check is still
  merged (§6). Tools should state the minimum reader when they write a name. A reader with the
  registry skips any name it does not know, so later additions do not repeat this.
- Version-2 clarification (2026-09-26, actor types, before any release): §7.2 now states that a
  negative `model.cullRadius`, `talk.range` or `look.range` reads as 0, and a zero or negative
  `model.drawDistance` as its default. A negative `look.range` previously acted as its absolute
  value. A `hideLimbs` entry past the skeleton's last limb, which never hid anything, now also logs
  an error. No document with non-negative distances changes meaning and none is rejected.
- Version-2 change (2026-09-28, actor types, before any release): each type is its own document,
  `unbound/actors/<name>.json`, named by its path (§7.2), instead of a key of one layer-merged
  `unbound/actors.json`. The single document was never released and is no longer read; types
  register in name order, so `$order` no longer applies to them.
